# Design

This document outlines the design principles and architecture of the ZIO Laminar Tapir library.

## Overview

The ZIO Laminar Tapir library is designed to provide a seamless integration between ZIO, Laminar, and Tapir, enabling developers to build reactive web applications with ease. The library leverages the power of ZIO for effect management, Laminar for reactive UI components, and Tapir for defining HTTP endpoints.

## Key Components

### 1. Endpoint Definition

Endpoints are defined using the Tapir DSL, allowing developers to specify the input, output, and error types of HTTP requests. The library extends the Tapir `Endpoint` class with additional methods to facilitate ZIO integration.

### 2. EventBus

The EventBus is a key component that facilitates communication between different parts of the application. It allows for the emission and subscription of events, enabling a reactive programming model. The EventBus is designed to work seamlessly with ZIO, providing a powerful mechanism for handling asynchronous events.

### 3. Error Handling
Error handling is managed through the `HttpError` class, which provides methods to encode and decode errors. This ensures that errors can be propagated through the ZIO effect system while maintaining type safety and clarity.

### 4. JSON Serialization
The library uses ZIO JSON for serialization and deserialization of data types. This allows for easy conversion between Scala case classes and JSON representations, making it straightforward to work with HTTP request and response bodies

### 5. Integration with Laminar
The library provides extensions for Laminar components, allowing developers to create reactive UI elements that can respond to events emitted by the EventBus. This integration enables a smooth flow of data between the backend and frontend, making it easy to build dynamic web applications.

## Design Principles


### 1. Type Safety
Type safety is a core principle of the library. By leveraging Scala's strong type system, the library ensures that errors are caught at compile time rather than runtime. This reduces the likelihood of bugs and improves the overall reliability of the application.

### 2. Reactive Programming
The library embraces reactive programming principles, allowing developers to build applications that can respond to changes in data and user interactions. The use of ZIO and Laminar enables a declarative approach to building UI components and handling asynchronous events.

### 3. Simplicity
Simplicity is a key design goal. The library aims to provide a straightforward API that is easy to understand and use. By minimizing complexity, developers can focus on building features rather than wrestling with the underlying framework.
