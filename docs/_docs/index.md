## ZIO * Laminar * Tapir


zio-Laminar-tapir is a library that leverages the power of [ZIO](https://zio.dev/), [Laminar](https://laminar.dev/) and [Tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/) to build web applications in Scala.

Under the hood, it uses [Fetch client](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/latest/backends/javascript/fetch.html) to handle HTTP requests and responses, allowing you to build reactive web applications with ease.


It provides a simple and powerful way, from a [Tapir endpoints](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/endpoint/basics.html#basics) definition, to handle requests and responses, and manage client-side rendering.

```scala sc:nocompile
// A single import
import dev.cheleb.ziotapir.laminar.*

AnEndpoints
            .get(1)         // (1) Build an ZIO effect from a tapir endpoint
            .emit(eventBus) // (2) Run the effect and emit the response to an event bus
```

In two steps:

1. Build a ZIO effect from a Tapir endpoint definition
2. Run the effect and emit the response to an event bus

It will handle:

* request and response marshalling
* jwt token when needed
* client management
