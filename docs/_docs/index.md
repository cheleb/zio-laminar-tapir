## ZIO * Laminar * Tapir


zio-Laminar-tapir is a library that leverages the power of ZIO, Laminar and Tapir to build web applications in Scala.

It provides a simple way to use tapir endpoints, as [Fetch client](https://sttp.softwaremill.com/en/latest/backends/javascript/fetch.html), call them and handle the response in a ZIO effect back to the UI.

It will handler jwt token, request and response marshalling and client management.

It depends on:
* [Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/) for compile-time metaprogramming and [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/) for client-side rendering.
* [Laminar](https://laminar.dev)
* [Tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/) for endpoint definition
